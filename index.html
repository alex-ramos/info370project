		<h1>Does the legalization of marijuana affect crime rates in Denver, CO?</h1>
		<h2>Final project for Info 370</h2>

		<h3>Abstract</h3>
		<p>With voting season wrapping up, what better topics to examine than those currently on 5 states ballots, like the topic of recreational marijuana. While many states like Colorado and Washington have already legalized the recreational use of marijuana, there is some ambiguity on the effects legalization has had besides raising tax revenue. Voters who support legalization believe that the drug is not dangerous and that the amount of money the marijuana industry makes can help the economy of the states who have legalized it. Colorado, one of the first states to have legalized the recreational use of marijuana, has developed claims in a Drug Policy Alliance that show positive effects of legalization. However, evidence for these claims is either not there or weak. We believe that voters should be informed on any issue they have a say on, and we want to provide an overlook of how legalization has impacted states and evaluate the claims made in the Drug Policy Alliance.</p>
